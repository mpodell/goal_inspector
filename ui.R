### shiny ui for 2014 FIFA World Cup Goal Data Inspector

### This app is very simple from structural point of view. It
##  1.  uses two select boxes, the second of which is dynamically updated 
##      based on the selection in the first 
##  2.  selections from the select boxes update a histogram, highlighting the data selected
##  3.  the histogram is build using rPlot from the package rCharts. The highighting is achieved by
##  4.  manipulating the color scale and tooltip arguements for the underlying polychart2 engine 
##        used by rPlot.

##  To make this assignment more interesting and to try building a R package, I used a dataset
##  not included in the base R packages. I extracted data from the openfootball database and 
##  built a dataset of goals from the just ended FIFA 2014 World Cup Finals in Brazil and deployed 
##  it to github so that it could be installed by shinyapp.io for my app.

require(rCharts)
library(devtools)
library(wc14goals)    # my dataset. package at https://github.com/mpodell/wc14goals
